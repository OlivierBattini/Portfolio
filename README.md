## My professional projects

### Connectivity Tester

This GUI application was developed to perform HTTP/TCP connectivity tests on various end points, on a the customer network (personal or professional).

### Licensing File Generator

This GUI application generates licence files based on a private key for licenced based applications.

### OpenBabel Service API

This service API uses the OpenBabel library to convert molecule file formats into usable geometric information such as :

- atom type
- atom position in the molecule
- covalent bond type and number

Data from this service API is then processed by a virtual world application.

### AIML Chat Bot for virtual worlds

This library uses the AIML (Artifical Intelligence Markup Language) interpreter library for .NET and connects to a NPC (Non Player Charater) in a virtual world application as a chat bot.

### Newtonian Gravity Real Time Simulator for virtual worlds

This newtonian gravity simulation library computes in real time position and velocity of 3D objects of the virtual world application.

### Molecule Viewer for virtual worlds

This library downloads and generates in the virtual world based on the specified molecule description file URL.

### Procedural Terrain Generation for virtual worlds

This library generates random terrain depending on user specified parameters and based on Perlin noise. The generated terrain is then loaded across the virtual world space.
